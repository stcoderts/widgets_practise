In this project, I have made 2 widgets, which are Stateful (Described in Stateful_page.dart file) and Stateless (Described in Stateless_page.dart file).
# Stateful widget
-  In a  Stateful widget an user can increment and decrement the counter located in the center of the page. For that, an user has to press either of '+' or '-' button.
- In order to use Stateful widget, user should comment the first-written-Class of main.dart class
# Stateless widget
- In a Stateless widget, you can see app's greeting
- In order to use Stateful widget, user should comment the second-written-Class of main.dart class
